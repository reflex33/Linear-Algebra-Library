# c# Linear Algebra Library
Library for linear algebra.  Includes sub-libraries for matrices and geometry currently.

## TODO
1. Add a class for a line.
2. Add a class for homogeneous transformation matrix?  Benefits: strong typing.  Detriments: lots of extra code.
3. Add a class for vector/vector3d?  Benefits: strong typing.  Detriments: lots of extra code.
